# Spread Heads (TestFlight) – 1.0.1

Release date: 2025-10-31

## What's New
- Rebranded app name and UI copy to “Spread Heads”.
- Face ID login: enable once and log in with biometrics next time.
- Scoreboard week display corrected to current NFL week.
- Onboarding quick start guide now shows only on first sign-in.
- Cloud sync: Leagues and picks now persist via Supabase backend.
- General stability and performance improvements.

## What to Test
- Sign in/out, then enable Face ID (Profile > Login). Relaunch app and verify Face ID unlock works.
- Create a league, invite a tester, and confirm it appears for both users after reinstalling the app.
- Make spread and over/under picks, then verify they appear across devices and after reinstall.
- Check Weekly Results and Leaderboard reflect your picks and points.
- Confirm the quick start guide only shows on the very first sign-in.
- Navigate Scoreboard and verify it shows the correct week.

## Fixes & Improvements
- Fixed occasional week mismatch on scoreboard.
- Improved label contrast on auth screens for accessibility.
- Reduced chance of losing data by migrating core features off local storage to Supabase.

## Notes
- External testers: if you see a blank leaderboard before making any picks, this is expected—make a pick to populate stats.
- If Face ID isn’t available on your device, the toggle will be hidden.
